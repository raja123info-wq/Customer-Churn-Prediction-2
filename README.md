This project predicts telecom customer churn using Logistic Regression, a simple and interpretable model. After cleaning and encoding the Telco Customer Churn dataset, the model is trained and evaluated using metrics like accuracy and ROC AUC. Key factors such as month-to-month contracts and certain payment or service types increase churn risk, while long-term contracts and higher tenure reduce it. The model’s coefficients clearly show why predictions are made, helping businesses understand customer behavior and design better retention strategies.
