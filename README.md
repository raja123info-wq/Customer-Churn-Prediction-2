Interpretable Machine Learning for Telecom Customer Churn Prediction Using Logistic Regression

Telecommunications companies face significant financial loss when customers discontinue their services. Accurately predicting customer churn and understanding the underlying drivers helps organizations design targeted retention strategies and maintain revenue stability. The objective of this project is to build an interpretable churn prediction model using the Telco Customer Churn dataset, a widely used dataset in customer analytics research. The dataset contains customer demographic information, service usage patterns, contract type, billing preferences, and a binary churn indicator.

This project uses Logistic Regression as the primary predictive model. Logistic Regression is an inherently interpretable statistical learning method that models the probability of churn as a function of customer characteristics. Because regulatory, ethical, and business environments increasingly require transparent analytics, Logistic Regression offers a clear advantage over more opaque algorithms. The model provides direct insight into feature contributions through coefficients, which indicate how strongly each variable increases or decreases churn risk.

To ensure robust and fair predictions, the data is preprocessed through systematic steps, including handling non-numeric fields, imputing missing values in the TotalCharges column, scaling numerical features, and applying one-hot encoding to categorical variables. The modeling pipeline standardizes numeric features and expands categorical variables into analytically useful indicator variables. The target variable is mapped into binary form, where churners are labeled as 1 and non-churners as 0.

The final model is trained using an 80/20 stratified split. Evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and ROC AUC quantify the performance of the model on unseen test data. These metrics help determine the model’s suitability for deployment in a business environment, where false positives and false negatives have direct financial implications.

Interpretability is central to the project. Logistic Regression coefficients provide global interpretability by highlighting the features that most strongly influence churn. For example, customers on month-to-month contracts tend to have a higher churn probability, while customers with longer tenure or multi-year contracts exhibit lower churn risk. Service-related features, such as electronic check payment methods or fiber optic internet, may also be associated with elevated churn risk. The model’s interpretive outputs allow business teams to understand behavior patterns and refine retention strategies accordingly.

In addition to global insights, the project implements local interpretability through coefficient-based contribution analysis for individual predictions. For any given customer input, the model computes the directional impact of each encoded feature on the final churn probability. This supports case-level decision-making, enabling customer service agents to provide clear explanations for risk assessments.

This combination of structured preprocessing, interpretable modeling, and transparent evaluation supports the responsible deployment of churn prediction systems in real-world telecom environments. By ensuring that both organizational stakeholders and customers can understand why a churn risk score is assigned, the project aligns with modern requirements for model governance, fairness, and accountability.
